University SQL project.

Business Synopsis
ABA Rentals was founded in August 2016 and was started as one small office. ABA Rentals was established by father and son, Sam and Robert Jones. ABA Rentals is a vehicle hire business. ABA Rentals’ main office is situated on 129 Bakerstone Road, which is an affluent area of Comber, County Down in Northern Ireland. ABA Rentals has various offices across County Down and County Antrim. In total there are 10 branches. The main office of ABA Rentals has a team of database developers at its axel. That office is thriving, and all accounts related to that Office are managed through a Head Office database.
ABA Rentals offers a variety of vehicle rentals for consumer and business use. The vehicles available include cars and vans of various sizes. ABA Rentals also has a set of luxury sports cars used widely by prestigious clients. The cars and vans are modern and include home brand names such as Ford, BMW and Volkswagen.
The company has had a lot of success since formation and has now decided to expand. Hence the 10 other branches which exist across County Down and County Antrim. Given the increased demand for its rentals, the company needs a database management system (nationally) to manage the bookings. The company has decided to recruit a team of SQL developers who will use SQL server to manage the bookings across the various branches. The goal of the database is to track all the bookings easily and manage clients. Prior to using a database, the company managers found that it was difficult to keep track of clients and their late returns of vehicles and any damage caused. With reference to the cost and profit element, the business has a team of accountants who track this through accounting software. The database is simply to keep track on all aspects of customers and vehicles.
